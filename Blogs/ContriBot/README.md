# Love your Contributors

Do you find yourself maintaining open source projects? Do you by any chance get amazing contributions?
I do. All the time. [My job is to make developers life easier](http://sendgrid.com/blog/get-paid-help-people-became-developer-evangelist/) and one of the ways I do so it developing and maintaining some of the [libraries](https://github.com/sendgrid) we provide our developers.

One day, the awesome [Nick Quinloon](https://twitter.com/yaynickq) sent an email containing this:
![ContriBot Inception](http://i.imgur.com/vqzEyro.png)

And thats how [ContriBot](https://github.com/elbuo8/contribot) was born!

ContriBot makes it super easy to do my job. At SendGrid we receive pull requests frequently, and ContriBot is always there go help us reward those amazing contributors.

Developers highly appreciate it when you go the extra mile to reward them.

ContriBot was originally written in Nodejs in a not so sober state of mind... Now its written in Go. There is a simple plug-in system that anyone can contribute to. Currently there is support for Basecamp, Email and HipChat. But the possibilities are unlimited.

If you run open source projects, you can use ContriBot too! Join me in making developers life more easy :)
