# SendGrid Takes GopherCon

A few months back, SendGrid's Tim Jenkins, announced how the we had adopted Go has our primary development language.
I got super excited about it because it was not long after I had gotten tickets to attend the first ever Golang
conference. Turns out the excitement spreaded like wildfire through the whole company and shortly after the list of 
people from SendGrid grew from 1 to 28! If you took pictures, chances are, a Gridder will be somewhere in the background!

Now, GopherCon was amazing. In my case, being surrounded by amazing engineers doing great things always humbles me. I had
the opportunity to geek out with very smart people in the Go community. It probably doesn't get better than that. I also had
take aways from several talks. My favorite being Peter Bourgon's talk. It served me and SendGrid's engineers as a validation
of the practices we have adopted while additionally adding some bits and pieces which we can integrate into our development 
process quite easily.

I took the time to some of SendGrid's amazing engineers for some feedback and this is what I got:

Quote from Rob Pike: 
"The language is way too young for people to claim this is the right way or this is the wrong way."

Vasko:
"Robert Griesemer's tip about preventing others from implementing your interface by including an unexported method in your interface."

Matthew:
"One comment during the conference that stood out to me was: "Don't use channels in performance critical paths."

Shane:
"The negative performance impact of using the `defer` keyword vs manually cleaning up stuff on function exit."

This were some of my favorite extracts from an email chain going down internally. If you feel excited about Go
as we feel in SendGrid, we'd be happy to talk to you. For hiring or just learning purposes. :)

Also, if you have a Go Meetup in your town, I'd be down to participate! Hit me up at [@elbuo8](https://twitter.com/elbuo8)
