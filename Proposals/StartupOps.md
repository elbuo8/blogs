When to DevOps and When to Just Dev

Young startups normally start out by focusing on product, often forgetting that the product will need to be deployed, maintained and scaled. In many cases this may be the right choice. In other situations you’re setting yourself up for a rough future. This talk identifies the situations where startups need to focus attention on DevOps and the times when they just need to Dev.

If your product is a standalone app or still a low traffic website, you can run a few bash scripts and save the day. This is acceptable technical debt, but many startups will eventually need to automate. Healthy companies mature from running Ops manually, to bash scripts, to some configuration management (i.e., Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc.) and eventually fully diving in to generate a solid Ops infrastructure. In some cases, such as running SMTP or ad servers at scale, Ops is important from the start--maybe as important as the product itself. This is the technical debt you don't want to accumulate.

SendGrid’s Yamil Asusta covers the signs that you need to put the same focus on DevOps that you do on Dev, with plenty of examples from a highly scaling email service and the rest of the startup world.
