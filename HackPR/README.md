# How I Organized Puerto Rico's First Hackathon

About a year ago, the very first hackathon hosted in my little island, [Puerto Rico](http://www.seepuertorico.com/), was being celebrated. It all started after I got somewhat obsessed with hackathons after seeing the dynamic in [Battle of the Braces](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/battle-of-the-braces-javascript). The [startup community in Puerto Rico](http://www.startupsofpuertorico.com/) is small, but growing steadily. Therefore I wanted to put my little grain of sand in the community. 

I partnered with a [Ramphis Castro](https://twitter.com/jramphis), a local entrepreneur. With barely two or three weeks of anticipation we got the word out in the different college campuses and in the startup community. We started to look for swag, prizes and donations to pay for the food and drinks in the event. [Giovanni Collazo](https://twitter.com/gcollazo) posted the [blogpost](http://elweb.co/1er-hackathon-de-startups-of-puerto-rico/) I wrote in HN. That caught SendGrid's [Mike Swift](https://twitter.com/swiftalphaone) eye. He offered to fly out and hang out with us. Some of the participants said that having him there was the best thing of the event.

The night before the event, we had locked down the food, venue and prizes. The day came and I thought no-one was going to show up. Turns out we had more people than expected. With one simple issue. There was no power on the venue! I freaked out. But everyone started hacking without power meanwhile me and Ramphis looked for a replacement venue. Thankfully, one hour later we moved to an [awesome place](http://www.telegrafo.com/history.shtml) were the administrators were super supportive.

At the end, we had demos for both software and hardware. People were super excited and started asking me to organize another one. Bigger. Much bigger. Their feedback was incredible. That hackathon was the gate for other hackathons and a more united community. 

If you want to organize a hackathon (student or non-student) and you are in a city where there are close to null hackathons, [hit me up](https://twitter.com/elbuo8). Here at SendGrid we are cooking up Frontier Hack, an iniative to help bring hackathons everywhere!
