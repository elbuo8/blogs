# Balanced Sponsorships

I have noticed that sponsorships are blowing up at insane rates. I'm not the only one. I've have sat down
at tables with fellow Evangelists from other companies even before I was one myself and this topic always comes
around. If you want a better picture of panorama, refer to [Nick's article](http://sendgrid.com/blog/youre-pricing-evangelist/).

Recently, my friends from back home ([Puerto Rico](http://seepuertorico.com)) asked me for some feedback on the
sponsorship doc they were working on for HackPR's third hackathon. I figured I would write them my opinions on 
I believe sponsorship tiers must look like.

Having previously being an organizer and now an Evangelist, I have a strong belief that Evangelists and APIs
play a strong role in hackathons and shouldn't be pushed aside.

Without further adieu:

## API Tier
* API Demo (5 minutes maximum)
* Distribute Swag
* Required to give a prize
* Evangelists/Engineers are more than welcomed

*If no representative can be sent, a web-demo can be given and the API prize will be chosen by the event organizers.*

### Plug-ins
* Logo on T-Shirts
* Logo on Website
* Pop-up Banner
* Resume Book

## Non-API Company

### Level 1
* Logo on Website
* Logo on T-Shirts
* Distribute Swag
* Resume Book
* Recruiters On-Site
* Can give prize
* Workshop(15-30 mins)

### Level 2
* Level 1
* Booth
* Pre-Access to Resumes/GitHub/LinkedIn
* Interview Rooms
* Infosession(30 mins maximum)

### Plug-ins
* Co-Sponsor
* Keynotes
* Pre/Post Company Event

*Keep in mind, a workshop != infosession. In a workshop, it is expected that a topic should be taught. In an infosession were the company will try to promote itself as much as possible.*

## Plug-in System
The plug-in system will basically provide Ã  la carte offerings. Of course, each plug-in will have an additional cost. That is where bundles/deals can be made that will benefit both sides.
