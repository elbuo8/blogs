# How I came to be Devangelist

I come from a small [beautiful little island](http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/wp-post-images/flamenco-1a.jpg)
called Puerto Rico. Where the term
Developer Evangelism is unheard of. The only references I had about it were a
[blog post](thenextweb.com/dd/2012/06/03/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-developer-evangelist/)
and what I could figure out from the livestream of hackathons
such as PennApps & hackNY. All I knew was the the title was a bit too religious.

I met [Swift](https://twitter.com/SwiftAlphaOne) when he came over to my first
hackathon. I got a somewhat clearer picture of his job. He left this thought
in my mind:
"He gets paid to help anyone with SendGrid and everything else too".
How awesome is that.

Fast forward a few months, a few hackathons started to pop in the scene in PR.
I obviously reached out to SendGrid for help but at the time they couldn't send
an Evangelist. *This is the point where the magic happened.* I was told I could
act as the representative for them in two events. And I did. And I **loved** it.
I demoed, helped people out and put smiles on peoples' faces.

Time passed and I became a [hackNY fellow](http://apply.hackny.org/).

reached out to me to grab lunch
during the program. He dropped something along the following lines on me:
"How would you like to go the same hackathons you are going to hit on your own
with SendGrid and help people out." My reaction:

I said yes. And from there it was hackathons all weekends. I had my 10-6 job
through out the week and after I would grab my backpack and go somewhere to
help people out. It suddenly became clear to me, I **love** doing this thing I
was doing. So the transition was quite obvious. Now here I am. Helping people out.
Might be SendGrid related. Might not be. Yet I'm here for you. So hit me up,
I'll help you out ;).
